\section{Introduction}

This report describes how to reproduce the main results of the PLDI'17 paper ``Component-based Synthesis of Table Consolidation and Transformation Tasks from Examples''. We consider the main results of the paper to be the ``Summary of experimental results'' presented in Figure 16 and the ``Cumulative running time of \toolname'' presented in Figure 17.

To facilitate the reviewing process we provide a virtual machine image available at \url{https://www.google.com/drive/}. We have installed \toolname on this virtual machine and created bash scripts to run \toolname and collect the results.

After downloading and importing the virtual machine, the reviewer can find all files related to \toolname in the directory \code{/home/morpheus/ae-pldi17-morpheus}. In the remainder of this report, we will refer to subdirectories of this directory. For instance, in the subdirectory \code{artifacts} the reviewer can find the files ``\emph{figure16.csv}'' and ``\emph{figure17.pdf}'' that correspond to the main results presented in the paper. The subdirectory \code{artifacts/solutions} provides a description of each benchmark and shows how \toolname can be used to solve them. In particular, the reviewer can find: (i) Stackoverflow post, (ii) input-output tables, (iii) synthesized solution by \toolname, and (iv) statistics on the running time and impact of deduction.

\section{Reproducing the main results of the paper}
\label{sec:main}

All experiments in the paper were conducted using an Intel Xeon(R) computer with an E5-2640 v3 CPU and 32G of memory running Ubuntu 16.04. Running times may vary on different machines but the overall relative performance of the different specs should remain the same. For instance, in the paper ``Spec 2'' solved 78 out of 80 benchmarks and ``No deduction'' solved 54 out of 80 benchmarks with a 5 minute timeout. We run \toolname inside of a virtual machine on a laptop using an Intel(R) with an i7-5600U and 8G of memory and it was able to solve 74 out of 80 benchmarks with ``Spec 2'' and 42 out of 80 benchmarks with ``No deduction''.

\subsection{Reproducing ``\emph{Figure16.csv}''}

The following steps should be done to reproduce the results in the subdirectory \code{artifacts/figure16.csv} which corresponds to Figure~\ref{tbl:fig16} in the paper.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the script:\\ 
\code{\$./run-morpheus-all.sh}\\
Morpheus will solve the 80 benchmarks from the paper using the 5 variants (``spec2'', ``spec2-no-pe'', ``spec1'', ``spec1-no-pe'', ``no-deduction''). Solving all variants can be very time-consuming and it may take up to \textbf{12 hours} for this script to finish.
\item After completion, the log files from this experiment are available in subdirectory \code{output}.
\item The \code{.csv} file can be generated by executing the following script:\\ \code{\$./table-morpheus-all.sh output figure16.csv}
\end{enumerate}

Since this experiment may take a very long time, we provide the log files from our experiments for the PLDI submission. These files are available in the subdirectory \code{logs}. The ``\emph{figure16.csv}'' can be generated using the original logs by executing the following command:\\\code{\$./table-morpheus-all.sh logs figure16.csv}\\

Instead of running all variants of \toolname, the reviewer can opt to run just a single variant. 
For instance, the reviewer can run \toolname with ``Spec 2'' (our most precise specification) with the following command:\\\code{\$./run-morpheus-variant.sh 1}

This variant should terminate within an hour and the reviewer can then generate a \code{.csv} file that contains partial information presented in Figure~\ref{tbl:fig16}:\\\code{{\scriptsize./table-morpheus-variant.sh output/spec2 figure16-spec2.csv}}

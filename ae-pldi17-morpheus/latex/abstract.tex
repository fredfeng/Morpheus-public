\toolname is a novel example-driven synthesis tool for automating a large class of data preparation tasks that arise in data science. Given a set of input tables  and an output table, \toolname synthesizes a table transformation program that performs the desired task. We have evaluated \toolname on dozens of data preparation tasks obtained from on-line forums, and we show that our approach can automatically solve a large class of problems encountered by R users.

\subsection{Solving an individual benchmark}

Since running all benchmarks are very time-consuming, the reviewer can opt to run one benchmark at a time.

To solve an existing benchmark:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the script:\\ 
\code{\$./run-morpheus.sh benchmarks/1/input.json specs/spec2 out.txt}\\
\item After completion, the log file from this run is available in \code{out.txt}.
\end{enumerate}

To solve a new benchmark:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The reviewer should provide inputs that meet the following requirements:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item All input and output tables are in CSV format. 
  \item All CSV files are separated by ``$\vert$" and the last CSV should be the output table
  \item The entire string of specifying the input-output should be quoted!
  \item As an example, the directory 'example/' contains a new benchmark that performs reshaping input1.csv and output1.csv are input and output tables, respectively. 
  \end{enumerate}

\item After that, run the script:\\
\code{.\scriptsize \$./run-morpheus.sh "example/input1.csv$\vert$example/output1.csv" specs/spec2/ out.txt}
\item In a few seconds, the output is available in \code{out.txt}.
\end{enumerate}
